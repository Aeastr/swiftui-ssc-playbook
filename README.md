# SSC Architecture Playbook

**Service + Store + Coordinator** — a practical SwiftUI architecture pattern.

This is mostly a rulebook for myself — a way to write down the structure I landed on while building Rally so I can stay consistent and reference it later. If it's useful to you too, great, but it's written from my experience, not as a universal standard.

Two documents:

- **[playbook.md](playbook.md)** — the architecture: what the three layers are, how they connect, when to use each one, and the mistakes worth avoiding.
- **[conventions.md](conventions.md)** — how it looks in code: file layout, MARK groupings, environment wiring, doc comments, error handling.
